I wish i could be creative with this summary but trust me it does not sound good in my mind.

This is just a simple blog of mine or you could say a digital scribble book!

I have always had a hard time puting thoughts to words and am tired of scribbling them in papers.

So its just a step to be organised in what i do.

Also the cat on the top left has Nothing to do with this blog i just used it because it looked cool and didn't wanna disrespect META for the effort it put to generate this.
The News on left i just didn't want that space to be empty and my techie mind(sarcasm) told me to be innovative and add real time updates of "who cares about what" updates around the world.

The upcoming events on the right. you will mostly see 1 or barely 2 moving infinitely i hope i keep updating it on time just like our govt education portals do("Click here! to see X results 1992").
